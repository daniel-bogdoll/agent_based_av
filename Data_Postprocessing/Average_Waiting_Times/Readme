**Missing Files**

- To run the Calculate_Average_Waiting_Per_Link.py, add the events file (taken from the MATSim Outputs) of the specific scenario to this directory (e.g., SC1.0_berlin-v5.5-10pct.1.events.xml.gz). Make sure to name the events file accordingly.

- To run the Extract_Heatmaps.py, add a network file (named: berlin-v5.5-network.xml). Make sure to name the events file accordingly. Additionally, this file can only be run after calculating the waiting time averages per link as it uses the xlsx outputs.
